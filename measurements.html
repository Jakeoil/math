            The quadrille and mosaic are examples of discrete tilings. These
            tilings use integers, or at worst, rational numbers (quotients of
            integers) to determine the placement of corners and lines. I found
            the current algorithm by doodling pentagons on a quadrille pad
            (graph paper) with each 1/4 inch square represented 4 by 4 units.
            The pentagons were not regular pentagons, but the looked kind of
            close. The consisted of three types of lines and their mirror images
            with slope of 0, 2/3 (33) and 4 (76). Using the three vectors, one
            can draw a reasonable facsimile of a regular pentagon. the first
            three tenths of a circle, they are meant to appoximate the angles, 0
            degree, 36 degrees and 72 degrees. From these angles, the other
            seven values can be derived through changes of sign.

            Also, there are sequentially larger versions of these vectors based
            somewhat on the fibinacci sequence. The first value always points up
            along the negative y axis. So they are: [0,4], [3, 2] and [4, 1].
            Note that the y value is set to positive to simplify the tables. The
            fibinacci sequence, starting is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5..] where F[n+1] =
            F[n] + F[n + 1] The simple example is [0, 4]. This is the length of
            the base of pentagon[0].

            Everything in the quadrille version so far is based on this base
            pentagon:
            <code>
                const pentaUp = [ [0, -3], [3, -1], [2, 3], [-2, 3], [-3, -1]]
            </code>
