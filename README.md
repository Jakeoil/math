To do list

-   [ ] Decagon is working although I would like to center rotation. Code is just plain to complicated at the moment.
-   [ ] Add the vector paths for the shapes.
-   [ ] Improve the mini grid figure.
-   [ ] Play with writing text on the canvas.
-   [ ] Do a rewrite using module.
-   [ ] Make the penrose a module with classes.
<script type="module" src="app.mjs"></script>
-   [ ] Design a theme and sub-theme hierarchy for rendering.
        For example we have graphics. Had core. But can be printer or screen. Maybe some other characteristics.
        Then we have scale. Kind of in between.

Color scheme and color scheme rules. The actual colors and strokes and backgrounds. Related to rendering.

Then we have the theme, the actual algorithm for the ultimate figures. And whether weâ€™re doing mosaic or vector or real is decided here.
