A file can contain a class. I would like to use the convention of capitalizing those files.
However, in many cases I do not wish to use new, but utilize a factory method.  Case in 
point (ha ha), point and ang.

The globals should be in a config file. not controls.

controls.js is a very overloaded module.

js should be called vend. We won't use vend, but node modules and parcel.
In other words, it will be obsolete.

blog.html should be moved to:
blog/src/index.html

coylean.html will be converted to a separate app and should be moved to 
coylean/src/index.html
coylean/src/coylean.js

deca and deca2 png files are assets.

math.css is core css and used by all the indexes.

move to
measurements.html
measurements.js
	point.js
	controls.js
	wheels.js
	shape-modes.js
	penroseScreen.js
	renderings.js
	
quadrille3 is research
rhombohedra html and js are research

There is much conflict between the two apps here
